        Hi everyone! This is my first time publishing an article on my new
        personal portfolio website. It is about the new version of my personal
        portfolio, developed using Next and Tailwind, and it consists of hero,
        about, blog, project, and contact sections.
      </div>

      <div className="my-[1.5rem]">
        You may be wondering why I uploaded it here and not on LinkedIn. It's
        because I've started adding all of my blogs to my personal portfolio.
        You can check them out on my{" "}
        <Link
          href={`/#blog`}
          target="_blank"
          className="text-primary hover:underline"
        >
          blog
        </Link>{" "}
        page.

      <div className="my-[1.5rem]">
        Have you noticed the UI of my article? It may be familiar to some of
        you, and that's because I replicated the Docusaurus UI. I find it
        awesome because of its margins that give elements room to breathe,
        making it easy to read. Additionally, there are some headers on the top
        right of where you are currently reading.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[1.5rem]">
        I am glad that upon developing these websites, I found that my
        technology skills have been expanding compared to my previous portfolio.
        That means that I have been working hard for these past few months, and
        this is the result.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[1.5rem]">
        In conclusion, reflecting on my career journey thus far, I'm pleased
        with the progress and results achieved. However, I acknowledge that my
        personal portfolio still has room for improvement. Moving forward, I'm
        committed to addressing these issues and enhancing its functionality.
        I'm excited to embark on the journey of transforming my portfolio into a
        dynamic website, and I invite you to stay tuned for the upcoming updates
        and improvements. Together, let's elevate my portfolio to new heights!
      </div>

      <div className="my-[1.5rem]">
        If you have any suggestions for improvements, please share them in the
        comment section of my LinkedIn post.
      </div>
      <div className="my-[1.5rem]">
        So what's next for me? For now I want to commit three things:
      </div>
      <ol className="list-decimal">
        <li className="ms-4">
          Further enhance my knowledge in back-end technologies.
        </li>
        <li className="ms-4"> Build a web system.</li>
        <li className="ms-4"> Learn a new programming language.</li>
      </ol>
    </article>
